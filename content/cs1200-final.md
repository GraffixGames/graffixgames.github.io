## The Most Helpful Lessions

This Semester of college taught me a lot. Before I got to college, I had never seen the need to make a schedule. In highschool I almost never had any homework, and it was rarely due more than a day later. It also was fairly easy to do all my homework in the ~20 minutes before class started. This was not the case here. I forgot to submit one of my CS2500 projects, even though I had finished it, and at that point I made a schedule for when each CS2500 and CS1800 homework was due. I had not made a schedule for my ENGW1111, CS1200 (sorry), or COMM2100. The time management project requiring me make a schedule really helped me, even if I didn't love doing it in the moment. The schedule saved me a lot of time, just by showing me when I should be working.

The most helpful assignment from CS1200 was the required advisor appointment. I am ashamed to admit it, but I don't know if I would have talked to my advisor without it. The appointment really helped me get an idea of my next four years, and made me more comfortable with the idea of talking to my advisor. I've even met with my advisor again!

While not as immediately useful as the other lessions, the resume and cover letter helped me a lot. I had a very bad resume that I hove really only used to get one job. The resume I made for this class, while still not the greatest resume ever, feels at least presentable. This also was the first time in my life I had even thought about cover letters, and having to write one for class made me more comfortable to apply for jobs and interships in the future.

## Advice for Future Students

1. Get smallest meal plan that you can, you don't need 15 meals a week, and it is way overpriced.
2. IV is overhyped. walking across campus is not worth it for basically the same food, swest is good enough.
3. Get a microwave, it is cheaper to get food you can microwave then it is to get takeout.
