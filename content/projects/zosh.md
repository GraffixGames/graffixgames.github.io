+++

zosh is an ongoing project to write a complete POSIX shell in
[Zig](https://ziglang.org/). Currently there is very little work done, but
progress is slowly being made. See the code on sourcehut
[here](https://git.sr.ht/~ntgg/zosh). An earlier attempt at writing a limited
subset of shell was done in C for a CS3650 class. The code for that version is
on sourcehut [here](https://git.sr.ht/~ntgg/nush).
