In 2017, in an Swift programming class, I had made [two](https://github.com/GraffixGames/Ultimate-Tic-Tac-Toe) [versions](https://github.com/GraffixGames/Ultimate-Tic-Tac-Toe-2) of ultimate tic-tac-toe. When I started to learn the Rust programming language, I thought that the dynamic enum system would be perfect for a project that I wanted to do while making the IOS versions of tic-tac-toe.
