This is a basic version of snake, written in [Zig](https://ziglang.org). This
was the first project I made with Zig, and as such, much of the code is messy.
It should run on Linux, Mac OS, and Windows, but I have not tested on any
platform other than Linux. You can find the source code
[here](https://git.sr.ht/~ntgg/snake-zig).
